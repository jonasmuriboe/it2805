			Our client: Hackerspace NTNU
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our primary contact with Hackerspace NTNU is Jonas Hermansen Muribø, leader av dev (the group responsible for the webpage).
			<h2>
				Purpose
			</h2>
			<p>
				The purpose of the website will be to inform students at NTNU about Hackerspace’s activites and to inform about what Hackerspace is and what they actually do. Therefore, our goals will be to show everyone what kind of projects that are made by people at Hackerspace. We will show this by making a page on the website dedicated to projects, where we will write a bit about some of the projects and add some pictures to hopefully increase the interest for technology by the students. Another goal for the website will be to tell about all the different groups that represent Hackerspace. There are in total five different, so it is important to write a little bit about all of them and what their responsibility and work is. The final goal for the website is to tell students when we are open. Hackerspace already have a javascript-code running on their website, which we will reuse and impliment in a new way.

			<h2>
				The audience
			</h2>
			<p>
				The website’s main audience will be people wanting to know more about Hackerspace and what they do. This audience is mostly represented by students at NTNU, but they would also like to target students from high schools(Vidaregåande?) and companies that work with technology. The idea is to let the students know when and where we are located and tell them when we are open. For the companies it is to let them know that Hackerspace are making some really cool projects, and hopefully convince them to sponsor Hackerspace with financial fundings or company products
